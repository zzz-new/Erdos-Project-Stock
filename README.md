# Erdos Project Stock v1.0
 
This project aims at predicting the trend of stock prices and takes Apple Inc. as an example stock to make the forecast. The project improves the baseline model ARIMA tremendously by adding multiple financial, macroeconomic and market factors. The project then builds a RNN model LSTM which also significantly improves the baseline model.

This project is expandable (for future work)
